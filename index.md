## Description

The following workshop will cover examples and guides for how to deploy
*Large-Language Models* (LLMs) into a production environment.

We'll cover the following:


- How to set up an endpoint in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).
- How to use AWS infrastructure and Terraform to fully deploy a LLM into production.
- Setting up GitHub's CICD to deploy such applications.

Some of the tools that we'll use in this workshop include, but not limited to:
- `Docker`
- `FastAPI`
- `Terraform`
- AWS infra (e.g. `ECS`, `ECR`, and more)

All of the source code can be found in the main repository in their
corresponding branches.
